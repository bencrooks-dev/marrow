# Changelog

All notable changes to `agentcore` are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) once it reaches 1.0; until then, API breaks may happen at any 0.x bump.

## [Unreleased]

### Added — ARI standard

- **`ARI-SPEC.md`** — the Agent Runtime Interface, a language-neutral spec for the agent runtime layer, with three conformance profiles (Core, Embedded, Server). agentcore is its reference implementation.
- **`ari-conformance/`** — executable conformance kit mapping each ARI requirement to a test; wired into CI (`conformance` job). Structural ARI-Embedded checks run without a build.
- **`docs/ari-strategy.md`, `GOVERNANCE.md`, `CONFORMANCE.md`, `docs/ari-rfc-process.md`** — adoption strategy, governance + path to neutral stewardship, conformance registry, and the spec RFC process.
- **`THREAT-MODEL.md`** — STRIDE threat model over the real attack surface with severities, trust boundaries, and an ARI-Embedded security profile.
- **`docs/pitch/`** — pitch deck (Marp) and one-pager. Market figures cited in `docs/market-research.md`.
- **`.github/workflows/security.yml`** — CodeQL (Python) + `pip-audit`.
- **`.github/workflows/docs-pdf.yml`** + **`scripts/render-pdfs.sh`** — render the doc set + deck to PDF and commit them to `docs/pdf/`.
- **`tests/test_security.py`** — adversarial/abuse tests tied to threat-model findings.

### Changed — security hardening

- **Cancellation + timeouts are now enforced** (previously plumbed but ignored): `Agent.step`/`stream` honor a pre-call `CancelToken`, and the OpenAI/Anthropic/Ollama providers pass `timeout_ms` through as a per-request wall-clock timeout and re-check cancellation between stream chunks. New helpers: `agentcore.sdk.raise_if_cancelled`, `request_timeout_seconds`.
- **`Message.content` cap can no longer be bypassed** by direct assignment — the binding validates against `kMaxContentBytes` on set (matching `Message.make`).
- **Tool-error redaction hardened** — default redactor scrubs more secret shapes (AWS/GCP/GitHub/Slack/JWT/Bearer/cred-URLs) and filesystem paths; new `ToolBox(strict=True)` returns the exception type only. New `strict_error_redactor`.
- **`RetryPolicy` guidance** — default retry set unchanged; documented how to narrow `retry_on` / widen `skip` for non-transient provider errors (4xx/auth) you don't want retried.

### Fixed

- **`StateStore` persistence dropped `Message.metadata`** on load — round-trip is now lossless (ARI §2.2/§8).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-26

The first **production-primitives release**. Five "gates" from PoC to product closed in one pass.

### Added

#### Production primitives

- **`CancelToken`** (C++) — cooperative cancellation. Pass via `GenerationRequest.cancel_token`; providers and tools check `cancelled()` at yield points.
- **`GenerationRequest.timeout_ms`** — wall-clock timeout providers should honor.
- **Bounded inboxes** on `AgentRouter` — `set_inbox_limit(agent_id, max_size, policy)` with `OverflowPolicy.{Reject, DropOldest, DropNewest}`.
- **`Engine.shutdown()`** — graceful stop. Blocks new `create_agent` calls; in-flight work on existing agents continues.
- **`Message.kMaxContentBytes`** — 4 MiB hard cap on message content; `Message.make` throws if exceeded.
- **`RetryPolicy`** — exponential backoff with jitter; configurable retryable / skip exception sets.
- **`RateLimiter`** — token-bucket, thread-safe; `try_acquire` and blocking `acquire(timeout)`.

#### Observability + persistence

- **`StateStore` Protocol** with two impls:
  - `InMemoryStateStore` — drop-in for tests.
  - `SQLiteStateStore` — durable, WAL mode, per-thread connections.
- **`restore_into(runtime, agent_id, store)`** — rehydrate history + system prompt on restart.
- **`TraceSink` Protocol** with three sinks:
  - `NullTraceSink` (default, zero overhead).
  - `PrintTraceSink` (development).
  - `OpenTelemetryTraceSink` (production; wraps an OTel tracer).
- **`UsageTracker`** + **`UsageRecord`** — token counts per agent/model + estimated cost via configurable pricing tables.
- **`agentcore.logging_config.configure_json`** — opt-in JSON-line structured logs on the `agentcore` logger.

#### Distribution + stability

- **`STABILITY.md`** — semver policy, public-API tiers (stable / experimental / internal), deprecation flow.
- **`ROADMAP.md`** — committed v0.1–v1.0 milestones with stretch goals.
- **PyPI publishing workflow** — `wheels.yml` now publishes to TestPyPI on `rc/a/b` tags and to PyPI on GitHub releases via trusted publishing (no token needed in secrets).
- **`docs.yml`** workflow — builds the mkdocs site on every push to main and deploys to GitHub Pages.

#### Docs

- **mkdocs-material site** at `docs/` with concept pages (agents, providers, tools, graphs, async, persistence, observability), API reference auto-generated via mkdocstrings, plus mirror pages for STABILITY/SECURITY/CHANGELOG/CONTRIBUTING/ROADMAP via pymdownx snippets.
- **Real example app** at `examples/apps/research_agent/` — 3-agent pipeline with real provider toggling, tools, tracing, usage tracking, and SQLite persistence. Resumes on restart.

#### Benchmarks

- **`benchmarks/`** suite: micro (`AgentState.append`, cache, router, tools), e2e (3-agent pipeline), comparison against LangGraph (separately installable via `[bench]` extra).
- Numbers on first run (M-series Mac, Python 3.12): ~1.4M `append`/s, ~672K router send+drain/s, ~64K full 3-agent pipeline iters/s. See `benchmarks/README.md` for the full table and reproducibility notes.

### Changed

- **Bumped to 0.1.0.** This is a real release; install extras stabilized.
- **`Runtime(...)` accepts new keyword args:** `rate_limiter`, `retry_policy`, `trace_sink`, `usage`. All optional with sensible defaults.
- **Provider GIL release made consistent** — `Provider::generate` and `generate_stream` both release the GIL on the base binding (previously only `MockProvider` did).
- **Tool error redaction** now optional via `ToolBox(error_redactor=...)`; default strips paths + `sk-` / `Bearer ` prefixes.
- **Schema generator** handles `Optional`, `Union`, `list[X]`, `dict`, `Literal[...]`.
- **`Agent.step()` and `Agent.stream()` accept `temperature`, `timeout_ms`, `cancel_token`.**
- **`Graph.run` returns `GraphResult`** and raises `GraphExhausted` on `max_steps` instead of silently truncating.

### Fixed

(Cumulative; see prior versions for individual entries.)

### Fixed

- **Critical: GIL race in `ToolRegistry::invoke`.** The Pybind11 binding previously declared `py::call_guard<py::gil_scoped_release>` while the C++ implementation copies a `std::function` that captures a `py::function`. The copy increments a `PyObject` refcount, which is undefined behavior in CPython without the GIL held. Removed the `call_guard`; the GIL is now held through invocation (which is correct since tools run Python anyway).
- **Critical: TOCTOU race in `Engine::create_agent`.** The engine previously released its mutex before calling `router_.register_agent`, opening a window where another thread could observe the agent in the engine map but get "unknown recipient" when sending to it. The engine lock is now held across both operations. Safe because `AgentRouter` never calls into `Engine`, so there's no inverse lock order.

### Added

- `tests/test_concurrency.py` — four contention tests that would have detected both bugs above. Covers concurrent create+send, concurrent tool invocation, cache contention, and history append/read races.
- `SECURITY.md` — vulnerability disclosure policy, threat model, and known security-relevant limitations.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file).
- `CODEOWNERS`, issue templates, PR template, Dependabot config — standard OSS hygiene.

### Changed

- `README.md` — toned down unbenchmarked "fast" claims pending real measurements; added a "Known limitations" callout near the top.

## [0.0.2] — 2026-05-26

### Added

- Streaming through the C++ core: `Provider::generate_stream(req, on_chunk)`, `Agent.stream(on_chunk=...)`. Pybind11 trampoline supports Python subclasses overriding `generate_stream`.
- Real provider implementations under `agentcore.providers`:
  - `OpenAIProvider` — Chat Completions API with streaming.
  - `AnthropicProvider` — Messages API with `cache_control: ephemeral` on system prompts (prompt caching).
  - `OllamaProvider` — local daemon at `http://localhost:11434`, no API key.
- Optional install extras: `agentcore[openai]`, `agentcore[anthropic]`, `agentcore[ollama]`, `agentcore[all]`.
- GitHub Actions workflows:
  - `ci.yml` — pytest matrix on Linux / macOS / Windows × Python 3.9–3.12, plus example smoke runs.
  - `wheels.yml` — `cibuildwheel` on `v*` tags or manual dispatch.

### Fixed

- Windows CI failed under cp1252 codec when example output contained Unicode (`→`). Added `PYTHONUTF8=1` and `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` to all CI jobs.
